### Instructions Overview
1. **Prepare the Cabbage**: Cut the napa cabbage into quarters and sprinkle with salt. Let it sit for about 1-2 hours until wilted.
2. **Make the Chili Paste**: Combine gochugaru, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, sugar, and water in a bowl. Add rice thickener and mix well.
3. **Combine Ingredients**: Rinse the cabbage to remove excess salt and drain. Massage the chili paste into the cabbage until thoroughly coated.
4. **Pack for Fermentation**: Place the kimchi into a jar, pressing down to ensure the brine covers the cabbage. Leave space at the top for fermentation gases.
5. **Ferment**: Allow to ferment at room temperature for a few days before refrigerating.

This recipe can be adjusted based on spice preference and additional vegetables can be included as desired.
