### Instructions Overview
1. **Prepare the Radish**: Peel and cut the radish into ¾ to 1-inch cubes. Place them in a large bowl.
2. **Salt the Radish**: Add salt and sugar to the radish cubes and mix well. Let it sit for about 30 minutes to draw out moisture.
3. **Make the Kimchi Base**: Blend the onion and apple with fish sauce, garlic, ginger, and some water until smooth. Mix this with gochugaru in a bowl.
4. **Combine Ingredients**: After draining excess water from the radish, add it to the kimchi base and mix thoroughly using gloves to avoid irritation from the chili flakes.
5. **Ferment**: Pack the mixture tightly into a clean jar, leaving some space at the top for fermentation gases. Allow it to ferment at room temperature for about 1-2 days before refrigerating.

This recipe can be adjusted based on personal taste preferences, including varying the level of spice or sweetness. Enjoy your homemade Kkakdugi!
